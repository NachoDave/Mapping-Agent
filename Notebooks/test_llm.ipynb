      " The sky appears blue due to a process called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight, which is made up of different colors, travels through the atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and small particles in the air like nitrogen and oxygen. Blue light has shorter wavelengths and gets scattered more because it fits easily into the gaps between these molecules and particles. The blue light scatters in all directions, creating a blue sky for us to see. This is also why the sun looks red or orange during sunrise or sunset: At those times of day, sunlight has to pass through more of Earth's atmosphere, which preferentially scatters shorter wavelengths (blue and green), leaving the longer wavelengths like red, orange, and yellow to reach our eyes."
