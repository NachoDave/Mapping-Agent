       "Message(role='assistant', content=\"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking why the sky is blue. I need to explain this in a clear and accurate way. Let me start by recalling what I know about this. I remember that it has to do with the scattering of light by the atmosphere. But wait, why blue specifically? I think it's related to Rayleigh scattering. \\n\\nSo, sunlight is white, but it's made up of different colors, each with different wavelengths. The Earth's atmosphere is made up of gases and particles. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, the molecules in the air scatter the light. Rayleigh scattering is when shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more than longer ones (like red and yellow). \\n\\nBut wait, why blue and not violet? I think the Sun emits more blue light than violet, and our eyes are more sensitive to blue. Also, some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere. So the combination of these factors makes the sky appear blue. \\n\\nI should also mention that during sunrise or sunset, the sky turns red or orange because the light has to pass through more atmosphere, scattering the blue light out of our line of sight, leaving the longer wavelengths. \\n\\nLet me check if there are any other factors. Maybe the presence of particles in the air, like dust or pollution, can affect the color, but that's more about the Tyndall effect, which is different. Rayleigh scattering is for smaller particles, like molecules. \\n\\nWait, the user might be a student or someone curious, so I should keep the explanation simple without too much jargon. Also, maybe mention that the human eye is more sensitive to blue, so even though violet is scattered more, we perceive the sky as blue. \\n\\nI need to make sure I don't mix up the different types of scattering. Rayleigh is wavelength-dependent, while Mie scattering is for larger particles, like water droplets, which is why clouds are white. \\n\\nSo putting it all together: sunlight is scattered by air molecules, shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) are scattered more, but our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and some violet is absorbed, leading to the blue sky. During sunrise/sunset, the path is longer, so blue is scattered away, leaving red/orange. \\n\\nI should also mention that the exact color can vary based on atmospheric conditions, like pollution or altitude. But the main reason is Rayleigh scattering. Maybe include a simple analogy, like a prism splitting light into colors, but the atmosphere scatters the shorter wavelengths. \\n\\nWait, is there any confusion with the fact that the Sun emits more blue light? Or is it just the scattering? I think both factors are important. The scattering is the main reason, but the actual intensity of blue light from the Sun also contributes. \\n\\nI should structure the answer step by step: first, sunlight composition, then scattering by atmosphere, explain Rayleigh scattering, why blue is dominant, and then mention the different times of day. Maybe add a note about the human eye's sensitivity. \\n\\nAlso, check for any common misconceptions. For example, some might think the sky is blue because the Earth's surface is blue, but that's not the case. The color is due to the atmosphere. \\n\\nOkay, I think that covers the main points. Now, present it in a clear, concise manner without being too technical. Use simple language, maybe bullet points or a numbered list for the steps. Make sure to highlight the key points: Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths, human eye sensitivity, and the effect of different times of day.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**, which involves how sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight Composition**:  \\n   Sunlight is a mix of all visible colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), each with different wavelengths. Blue and violet have the shortest wavelengths, while red and yellow have longer ones.\\n\\n2. **Atmospheric Scattering**:  \\n   When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules (like nitrogen and oxygen). These molecules scatter light in all directions. Shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) are scattered **much more** than longer wavelengths (red/yellow). This is called **Rayleigh scattering**.\\n\\n3. **Why Blue, Not Violet?**  \\n   - The Sun emits more blue light than violet.  \\n   - Human eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet.  \\n   - Some violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, reducing its contribution.  \\n   Together, these factors make blue the dominant color we perceive.\\n\\n4. **Sunrise and Sunset**:  \\n   During these times, sunlight travels a longer path through the atmosphere. This scatters most of the blue light out of our line of sight, leaving the longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow) to dominate, creating the warm hues of sunrise/sunset.\\n\\n5. **Other Factors**:  \\n   - **Pollution or particles** (like dust or water droplets) can alter the scattering, sometimes making the sky appear more white or gray (Tyndall effect).  \\n   - **Altitude** also affects the color: at higher altitudes, the thinner atmosphere scatters less light, making the sky appear darker blue.\\n\\nIn summary, the blue sky is a result of Rayleigh scattering, the human eye's sensitivity to blue light, and the Sun's emission spectrum. The exact shade of blue can vary depending on atmospheric conditions and the time of day. ðŸŒˆ\", images=None, tool_calls=None)"

      "Let me recall. Sunlight is white, which is a mix of all colors. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, the molecules and small particles in the air scatter the light.

      "But wait, why not violet? Because the sun emits more blue light than violet, and our eyes are more sensitive to blue. Also, some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere. So the combination of more blue light and our eyes' sensitivity makes the sky blue. \n",

      "Also, during sunrise or sunset, the sky turns red or orange because the sunlight has to pass through more atmosphere, so the blue light is scattered away, leaving the longer wavelengths like red and orange.

      "I should make sure to explain the scattering process clearly. Maybe mention that it's called Rayleigh scattering, which is wavelength-dependent. Also, clarify that it's the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere, not the actual color of the sky itself. \n",

      "Wait, are there any other factors? Like the presence of different particles or pollutants? But under normal conditions, Rayleigh scattering is the main reason.

      "I need to present this in a simple way, avoiding too much jargon. Start with the basic idea of sunlight and scattering, then explain the wavelength aspect, and the role of human eyes.

Hmm, maybe mention that the atmosphere is a mix of gases and particles, but the scattering is primarily due to molecules, not larger particles. Yeah, that's important. So the key points are: sunlight composition, Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths scatter more, blue is more prevalent and our eyes are sensitive to it, and the effect of atmospheric depth during different times of day.\n",

So, moving from previous node (test_centre) to current node (test_centre_road), the longitude increases from -0.29299 to -0.2928, which means moving east.
