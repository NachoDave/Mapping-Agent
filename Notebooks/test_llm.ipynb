      "Let me recall. Sunlight is white, which is a mix of all colors. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, the molecules and small particles in the air scatter the light. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to red, orange, yellow, etc. So blue light is scattered more in all directions by the gases and particles in the atmosphere. That's why the sky appears blue to us. \n",

      "But wait, why not violet? Because the sun emits more blue light than violet, and our eyes are more sensitive to blue. Also, some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere. So the combination of more blue light and our eyes' sensitivity makes the sky blue. \n",

      "Wait, are there any other factors? Like the presence of different particles or pollutants? But under normal conditions, Rayleigh scattering is the main reason.

Hmm, maybe mention that the atmosphere is a mix of gases and particles, but the scattering is primarily due to molecules, not larger particles. Yeah, that's important.
